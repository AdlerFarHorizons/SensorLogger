Initial version from Jeff Wiedemann's code of May 2014, written for Teensy 3.0 (See file "pressure_and_accel_and_mag_4_w_gps_4.ino.ref").
  
Modified to use a separate Teensy version of the HMC5883L library
incorporating minor changes as used by Jeff.

CONFIG.TXT configures MUST be on the SD card in order to set the correct serial data rate for the logger.
